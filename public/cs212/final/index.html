    <article id="addendum">
        <p>I was surprized to find that this was actually an ejoyable lab.
            I'm writing this addendum the same day that I started working on this lab, which is not
            at all what I thought was going to happen. With all of the past projects, syntax has been
            the thing that I get the most hung up on, and for this lab I had very little struggle with
            it. The one breakthrough that I had for syntax was realizing that I could use querySelectorAll
            to select all of my boxes. Before I remembered I could use that, I was envisioning a never 
            ending future in copy and paste hell, so you could that I was relieved to figure that out. 
            The actual logic for this project wasn't too bad. I would say that it was more enjoyable
            than in past projects where I stuggled with syntax because when I did get stuck I still 
            felt like I could logic my way through the next obstacle.</p>
        <p>I'm pretty happy with the design for this website. A black and white look seemed
            fitting to match the theme of the project, and I wanted it to look kind of minimalist
            and modern. This is probably the most visually appealling lab that I've created.
        </p> 
        <p>Throughtout this project there were three main things that I stuck to and found to be very helpful. The 
            first was to plan things out ahead of time. While I like to fly by the seat of my pants
            in most areas of my life, I've found that it doesn't work too well for coding. The second
            thing I found useful for this project was reminding myself to take breaks when I felt I was
            hitting a wall. I didn't always do this, but when I did I was reminded of how befecial it is.
            The third thing that helped me for this project was coding with the a priority for functionality
            before efficiency. In the past I've found that I can get hung up on making the program as efficient as 
            possible to start, and it usuaslly only ends of making the process drawn out and miserable, 
            so that honestly might be the most useful strategy I had for this project.
