        <h1> Lab 3 </h1>
        <p class="one">
            For this lab, I found that I could retrieve fonts from a local directory or from a separate website.
            I opted to retrieve my fonts from a website since I wasn't worried about loading speed and like
            the ease of use that goes along with accessing fonts from a separate server. 

        </p>
        <p class="two">
            To start, I first went to google fonts and found the fonts that I wanted to use.
            Once I had my fonts selected, I used the HTML that was generated to link to the specific fonts that I wanted
            on the website. I put the links into my HTML <strong>before</strong> the link to my CSS file. With my newly
            selected fonts linked to my client, all that was left was for me to assign the fonts to the elements that I wanted
            in my CSS file. 
        </p>
        <p class="three">
            With all of that done and completed, I now have this jenky website to behold
