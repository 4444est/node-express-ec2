            <p>
                I ran into a plethora of issues for this project. To begin, I was unsure how I should structure my website, and 
                if I am supposed to use buttons to update the html. The main issue that I had for this was project was passing a variable
                into a function to represent an object. I search for hours trying to find ways that I could get it to work. Eventually I 
                decided to create a function that would translate the variable in the correct object and pass that object into the function.
                I got that to work for the first object, but couldn't get it to work for the next object, since I couldn't find a good way
                of returning the correct object variable to be used for the next button. In the end I wasn't able to finish this project even 
                after putting a lot of time into it. What I should have done was take a minute to step back and reevaluate how I should approach
                this problem because at this point in time, I now understand that I should have created one object with all of my stages
                and stage specificationd within those. I didn't know that you could do this and it would have made my life much easier.
                I can't change the past, so I hope to learn from this going forward.
