            <p>For this lab I decided to create a website that can calculate the
                hypotenuse of a triangle given the length of it's two other sides.
                I found that the logic for the JavaScript function to be the easiest
                part by far. Getting the holy grail setup took some time, but
                the part of this lab that I struggled with the most was getting the 
                button and user input to work correctly, and link up to everything else.
                Having completed the assignment it seems extremely easy, but it took me 
                good chunk of time to figure where everything was supposed to go, and 
                the correct syntax to use. Since there are so many ways to do things
                with JavaScript and HTML, I found myself moving from method to method thinking
                that differenty syntax might solve the problem while the real issue was lurking
                somewhere else in my code. The thing that allowed everything to come together
                was the positioning of my input variables. I didn't realize that I needed to
                put them within my click function for them update. Now that I understand how it
                works it seems quite obvious, but I had assumed that they would update once a value was
                passed into them.
