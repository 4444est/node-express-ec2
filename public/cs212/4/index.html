        <p class="intro">
          Last year saw the works of Virginia Woolf enter the public domain in many
          countries around the world. To celebrate Emma Sutton looks at Woolf's short
          story "A Simple Melody" and the influence which music had upon the writer
          who once wrote that music was "nearest to truth".

            As Virginia Woolf’s letters and diaries amply record, music was a central part
            of her social life as it was for many of her contemporaries and she was at her
            best as a humorist writing about these occasions. She records with glee the
            various mishaps that befall musicians and audiences – a prima donna throwing
            down her music in a rage; a button popping off the plump Clive Bell’s waistcoat
            during the slow movement of a piano sonata; an elderly man crashing loudly but
            astonishingly unhurt down the stairs at Covent Garden. The social conventions,
            artifice and pretensions governing these performances intrigue her and allow her
            to sharpen her wit, but music wasn’t only an occasion for slapstick humour or
            social satire. It played a central part in the political vision of Woolf’s writing,
            shaping her understanding and representations of feminism and sexuality, pacifism
            and cosmopolitanism, social class and anti-Semitism. And it informed, too, the
            formal experiments of her prose. Woolf learned many of her astonishing literary
            innovations from music – adopting from Wagner’s operas, for example, the technique
            of shifting from one narrative perspective to another in order to represent the
            unspoken thoughts and feelings of her characters.

            The short story ‘A Simple Melody’ (c.1925) encapsulates her acute interest in
            music and its resonant but discreet place in her work. In it, the principal
            character masks his discomfort at a formal party by studying a landscape painting
            hanging on the wall:
          </p>
            <p>
              <pre>
                <em>
                  Mr Carslake, at least, thought it very beautiful because, as he stood in the corner
                  where he could see it, it had the power to compose and tranquillize his mind. It
                  seemed to him to bring the rest of his emotions – and how scattered and jumbled
                  they were at a party like this! – into proportion. It was as if a fiddler were playing
                  a perfectly quiet old English song while people gambled and tumbled and swore,
                  picked pockets, rescued the drowning, and did astonishing – but quite unnecessary
                  – feats of skill. He was unable to perform himself.

            The difficulties of communication and the importance of the unspoken are central
            themes of Woolf’s brief sketch. This is a story about language, about communication.
            The inhibitions restricting the conversation among the party’s guests, and the
            difficulty of finding ‘pure new words’ in which to express his feelings, frustrate
            Mr Carslake. As he looks at the painting of a heath Mr Carslake imagines walking on
            it with a variety of companions, longing for the intimacy and social equality that
            he sees as characteristic of al fresco conversation in contrast to polite small talk:
          </p>
          <pre>
      Why, very likely they would talk about their own habits for a whole hour; and all
      in the freest, easiest way, so that suppose he, or Mabel Waring, or Stuart […]
      wanted to explain Einstein, or make a statement – something quite private
      perhaps – (he had known it happen) – it would come quite natural.
              </pre>
          <p>
            His association of the landscape with song suggests that music, like these imagined
            outdoor exchanges, represents a more direct or ideal form of communication than
            language, an idea that Woolf’s writing repeatedly explores. She was fascinated by,
            but wary of, the idea that music was a form of total expression, a model that writing
            could aspire to or imitate. Here, Mr Carslake’s comparison of the painting to an ‘old
            English song’ celebrates music’s expressivity and capacity to confer order on its
            listeners, but also evokes the extensive contemporary nationalist writing about English
            folk song, landscape and early music by the composers and teachers of the English
            Musical Renaissance. Mr Carslake remarks that he has recently attended the British
            Empire Exhibition at Wembley, at which English folk songs and military marches were
            performed: he found it ‘very tiring’ and ‘believed it was not being a success’. These
            bathetic details undercut nationalist and military music, suggesting that he, like Woolf
            herself, was repelled by it. Yet Mr Carslake's belief that music confers ‘proportion’
            on the listener echoes the catchphrase used by the unfeeling doctors treating
              shell-shocked war veterans in her contemporary novel <em>Mrs Dalloway</em>, using music to
            suggest a more troubling aspect to his fantasies about communication: his ‘desire […]
            to be sure that all people were the same’ and ‘very simple underneath’ is both crudely
            reductive, as he partly recognises, and indicative of empathy and a wish for real
            connection with others.

            The allusion to music also allows Woolf to flesh out aspects of her character’s inner life that
            could not be addressed directly: the story draws on music’s contemporary association with
            homosexuality, which is further implied through the description of Mr Carslake as a ‘queer
            fish’ whose ‘affections’ for his butler are the subject of speculation by his friends.
            These details hint at a more unconventional and warmer private life than is apparent
            through his conversation at the party – or through his slightly sinister wish for human
            homogeneity and simplicity. Similar uses of music pepper Woolf’s fiction: in her first
              novel, <em>The Voyage Out</em>, her heroine plays a Beethoven piano sonata usually perceived as
            ‘unattainable’ for women, augmenting the references to her growing feminism. In <em>Night and
              Day</em>, references to Mozart’s operas criticise the power of patriarchal society and in <em>Jacob’s
            Room</em> a performance of Tristan contributes to the numerous allusions attacking the war
            mongering of Edwardian society and its imperial activities. In <em>The Years</em>, Woolf’s account
            of a performance of Wagner’s <em>Siegfried</em> resists the composer’s notorious anti-Semitism, using
            the opera to embed more sympathetic attitudes towards Jews in the novel.
          </p>
          <p>In a famous letter of 1940, Woolf wrote that ‘I always think of my books as music before I write them’;
            recent criticism has started to explore the implications of the relationship between music
            and writing in her work. And although music has often been seen as the art in which Bloomsbury
            was least interested, Vanessa Bell’s work as a set designer for ballets, Bell’s painting (with
            Duncan Grant) of a music room for the Lefevre Gallery in London, and the central place of
            musical terms in Roger Fry’s art criticism all illustrate music’s importance to Woolf’s family
            and friends. Woolf shared a passionate interest in ‘intermediality’ with the Modernists,
            including T.S. Eliot, James Joyce, Gertrude Stein and Katherine Mansfield, too. She spoke,
            then, for many of her contemporaries when she wrote in a letter of 1899 that music, rather than
            literature, seemed to her the ‘nearest to truth’.

              &ensp;&ensp; For this lab I wanted the website to read as an article. In order to make this happen I 
              created a large margin around the entire page and added a large styleized title. Initially
              I wanted the background of the website to be a nice cream color, but ultimately opted against it for 
              the default white color because I felt that the black text on a white background worked better
              with the black and white photos featured in the article. 
                 
            </p>
            <p>
              &ensp;&ensp; For this websites fonts, I settled on a plain, but clean font for the body of the text, and a more 
              styleized font for the title. For the photo descriptions I used the same font as the body,
              but altered it to have a smaller font weight. For the subtitles of the page I kept them
              bold and slightly larger than the body in the same font.
            </p>
            <p>
              &ensp;&ensp; For this websites photos, I decided to make my text wrap around them. I felt that this was more
              visually appealing, and allowed the website to flow better. In the end, I decided to learn how to make 
              a photo circular, and have text wrap around it. I only did this for the first picture, since the focus is 
              on Virginia Woolf, and the corners don't hold any valuable information. For the second picture featuring
              a woodcut by Virginia's sister I felt that I made more sense to keep the entire picure, so I kept it square.
            </p>
            <h3>HTML abuse</h3>
            <p>
              &ensp;&ensp; I made a point to keep an eye out for any and all html code that mode sense visually, but 
              not structurally. In the end I was only able to find one heading that needed to be changed. Ironically, this 
              was the addendum header, which need to change from an h1 header to a h2 header. Apart from that, I didn't spot anything else 
              that needed to be changed.
